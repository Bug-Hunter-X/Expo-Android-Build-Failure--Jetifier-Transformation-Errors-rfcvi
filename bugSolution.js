To solve this issue, you can try several approaches:

1. **Clean your project:** This step ensures that no lingering files from previous attempts obstruct the process.  Run `expo prebuild --clean` before attempting to build again.

2. **Skip Jetifier (use cautiously):**  Use this only as a workaround if you're confident about your dependencies compatibility. Use the `--skip-android-jetifier` flag with `expo prebuild`:

```bash
expo prebuild --skip-android-jetifier
```

3. **Update or Remove Conflicting Dependencies:**  If you see a specific error pointing to a library, check if a newer version of that library exists that has AndroidX support. If not, consider replacing it with an alternative.

4. **Create a Fresh Project:** A clean project is often the best approach. Start with a fresh Expo project, gradually adding your existing components and functionalities. This helps identify whether the problem stems from a specific library or a configuration issue in your project.

5. **Check your package.json:** ensure you use the appropriate expo and react-native version, if you are using an older version of expo and react-native, you need to update both to the latest version

**Example of using `expo prebuild --skip-android-jetifier` (in a bash script):**
```bash
expo prebuild --skip-android-jetifier
expo start --android
```

Remember, skipping Jetifier might introduce issues down the line if your dependencies aren't compatible with AndroidX.  The recommended long-term solution is to ensure all your third-party libraries are AndroidX-compatible.
