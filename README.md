# Expo Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transformation Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI, specifically issues related to the `jetifier` transformation process and conflicts with AndroidX.

## Problem

The Expo build process fails during the Android build phase, encountering errors related to missing classes or unresolved dependencies.  This typically happens when third-party libraries used in your project haven't been properly migrated to use AndroidX, causing conflicts with newer Android versions.

## Solution

The provided solution involves using the `expo prebuild` command with the `--skip-android-jetifier` flag.  It's crucial to examine your project's dependencies and ensure they're compatible with AndroidX to prevent these kinds of issues in the future. The solution also includes using a fresh environment to avoid lingering issues from previous builds. This is the recommended practice for Expo developers to address similar issues.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bug.js)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Try to build the Android app using `expo prebuild`.  You'll likely observe the error.

## Solution (for bugSolution.js)

1. Create a fresh Expo project to avoid conflicts.
2. Clean your Expo project: `expo prebuild --clean`. 
3. Build the Android app using `expo prebuild --skip-android-jetifier`.
4. Try to run the app again; if that doesn't solve it, you might need to update or remove conflicting dependencies listed in the original error message.
