This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `jetifier` process. The error message may vary, but it often indicates an issue with transforming third-party libraries that use AndroidX.  The build process fails because it cannot resolve certain dependencies or packages, usually related to old support libraries that conflict with AndroidX.

```bash
error: cannot find symbol class ...
